# presentations
This is a selection of presentations I have generated as a student at UMass Amherst. 

- `bburns-lie-bkgd.pdf` was presented to [DARoS Lab](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/daros/sample-home-page/) as background for a future presentation on lie group robotics
- `bburns-tda.pdf` is an overview on topological data analysis, largely a paper share of [Singh et al.](https://research.math.osu.edu/tgda/mapperPBG.pdf), to the [UMass Theory Seminar](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/theory/theory-seminar/) on 11/1/2022
- `page-rank` was my final group project presentation on Page Rank for Math 455: Discrete Structures.
